# Task
Create a console program in Java and write a class from your lab 1:
1. Additional 5 private fields that best describe this class (in addition to the fields listed in the table)
2. Methods for accessing these fields (for example for the field name - getName () and setName ())
3. Static field (numeric type)
4. You must add 2 protected fields for each class.
5. The fields in items 3 and 4 must represent the attributes of the described class
6. Default constructor, constructor with four parameters (the first four properties according to claim 1) and constructor with all fields. When working with constructors, you should forward the call to one of the constructors using this and avoid copying the code.
7. Methods
    toString - display information about the object
    Static method printStaticField () - displays information about the value of the static field (where Field - field name)
    The printField () method - displays information about the value of the static field
    resetValues ​​- changes the values ​​of all fields to those passed in the parameters
8. The developed code must be poured into the hit repository! The repository should have a README and .gitignore file.

In the main () method, define 3 objects of type from the task (due to different constructors) and output information about them using the toString () method and output information using the printStaticField () and printField () methods
